# ðŸ“Š Learn Data Science with Python

This repository contains essential topics to master Data Science using Python â€” from basic data manipulation to machine learning fundamentals.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics and Definitions

### 1. Introduction
Basic setup of the data science environment, including Python, Jupyter Notebook, and essential packages.

### 2. Pandas & NumPy  
Libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations. Pandas is used for working with structured data, while NumPy handles numerical arrays.

### 3. Matplotlib & Seaborn  
Visualization libraries in Python. Matplotlib offers customizable plots, and Seaborn provides statistical graphics built on top of Matplotlib.

### 4. Linear Regression & Logistic Regression  
Supervised learning algorithms. Linear Regression predicts continuous values; Logistic Regression is used for binary classification.

### 5. Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors  
Tree-based and instance-based machine learning models used for classification and regression tasks.

### 6. K-Means  
An unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data into distinct groups based on similarity.

### 7. NLP (Natural Language Processing)  
Techniques to process and analyze text data, including tokenization, vectorization, and classification of text.

### 8. Intermediate  
This section focuses on building practical machine learning models using TensorFlow, including real-world datasets and project exercises.
